# Cognitive Modelling: Complex Behaviour Project for Team 2
Assignment repo for the Cognitive Modelling: Complex Behaviour course at the University of Groningen(2023). 

## Project 3: Halli Galli

Halli Galli is a game in which players turn over cards with fruits on them. As soon as the total number of specific fruits is five, the first player to hit the bell in the middle gets all the cards. But if you make a mistake, you are penalized. See https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2944/halli-galli for rules and strategy.

You should build an App to play the game, and a model that can play the game realistically. Important aspects are arithmetic skills, but also anticipation.

There are 4 kinds of fruits, each has 14 cards, thus 56 in total. For every kind of fruit it consists of:
- 1 fruit: 5 cards 
- 2 fruits: 3 cards
- 3 fruits: 3 cards
- 4 fruits: 2 cards 
- 5 fruits: 1 card
